## What is Home Assistant?

Home Assistant is an Open Source Home Automation software that integrates with a
plethora of existing smart home frameworks and integrates these all together. In
contrast to proprietary frameworks, Home Assistant integrates with many other
existing ecosystems (e.g. Amazon Alexa or Apple Homekit) and focuses on local
control and privacy.

Depending on the type of your smart home device, Home Assistant can be run
on your local network and without internet access.


## What can Home Assistant do for you?

Home Assistant allows you to regain control over your smart home devices without
relying on external cloud providers or any internet connection at all (this is
only possible if your smart home devices actually support running without a
cloud).

Additionally, Home Assistant features a very intuitive UI including companion
apps for IOS and Android, complex automations, support for energy tracking, a
scene system and much, much more.

Irrespective whether you just like to turn that one light on or off from your
phone or you'd like to go down the automation rabbit hole completely, Home
Assistant has you covered.
