title: The Awesome Open Source Guides
---

Welcome to the Awesome Open Source Guides, a collection of Guides, Tutorials and
Links about using and running Open Source.


## Scope

This project is focused on the usage of open source and less on running open
source projects or maintaining a community. There are other great collections,
guides or books about those topics, including but not limited to [Cornelius
Schumacher's
awesome-open-source](https://github.com/cornelius/awesome-open-source) or
[Daniel Stenberg's Uncurled](https://un.curl.dev/).


## Contributing

Anyone can contribute to this Guide collection!

Have you written a guide and would like to integrate it into this project, but
don't know what Markdown and Hugo are or how to use them? Then just head over to
our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SUSE/awesome-open-source-guides),
create an issue and put your content into the issue description or attach it as a
file. We'll handle the conversion for you.

If you know your ways around with markdown, then either edit an existing file or
create a new one in the [`content`](./content) subdirectory. You can do this via
the GitHub user interface, [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/),
[VSCode.dev](https://vscode.dev/) or your favorite text editor on your machine.
