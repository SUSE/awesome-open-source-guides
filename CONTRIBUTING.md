Welcome to the list of awesome open source and thanks for considering to
contribute. Contributions are welcome so we can tap into the collective
knowledge and wisdom about how to run open source.

Please [open a pull
request](https://github.com/cornelius/awesome-open-source/pulls) if you would
like to contribute new or improve existing items. If you would like to comment
on or discuss content but don't have concrete changes yet, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/cornelius/awesome-open-source/issues).

The scope of the list is resources helpful in running open source projects. The
focus is software but adjacent areas are welcome as well. The list is not about
collecting open source projects but more about the meta topic of why and how to
do open source successfully.

This is a curated list so the goal is not to collect all possible resources but
collect the ones which are most helpful, provide a unique perspective, or are
of special significance. Resources providing an overview about an area or
aspect of open source are preferred over links to specific instances or
implementations. Links to specific examples are welcome, though, the
description should include information what makes the examples special, then.

so that it can broadly be used and shared by everybody.
By submitting pull requests you agree to share your contributions under the same license.
